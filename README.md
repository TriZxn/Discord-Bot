# Discord Bot
This is the code for a basic discord bot you can setup for your server with your friends. It's very linear and easy to add new commands too. You can use repl.it and uptimerobot.com to keep your bot running. Just add both .py files into your repl. Take the webste url from the website that pops up, and set it into uptimerobot with a 5 minute interval to keep it running. If you have any problems just DM me on discord @TriZxn#6839. I will post a full tutorial on my youtube soon, so be sure to look-out for that! Make sure you replace 'YOURTOKEN' with the token given to you by the discord website.
